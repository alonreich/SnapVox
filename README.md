> **🔗 These links never go stale.** They are GitHub *latest-release* permalinks — they always resolve to the most recently published build, so whenever you click them you get the newest version. SnapVox deliberately keeps **exactly one release alive at any time**: every publish deletes all previous releases and their tags, no exceptions.

## ✨ Features

| 🎯 Feature | ✨ Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🖥️ **Precision Capture** | Capture your entire screen, a specific window, or an exact rectangular region across multiple monitors — effortlessly. |
| 🎨 **Premium Image Editor** | A sleek, dark-themed editor that feels natively premium, with snapping, zooming, and multi-monitor awareness. |
| 🖍️ **Rich Annotations** | Arrows, shapes, freehand drawing, numbered steps, pixelate, Greenshot-style marker highlight, and text overlays. |
| 🤖 **Interactive OCR Mode** | Powered by Tesseract. Toggle into OCR mode right inside the editor — the UI fades away, detected text is highlighted live, and you click-and-drag to copy exactly what you need. |
| 🚀 **Blazing Fast** | Hyper-optimized **Native AOT** build for instant launch times and a tiny memory footprint. |
| ⚙️ **Highly Configurable** | Global hotkeys, startup behaviors, multi-monitor notification overlays with a configurable blink duration, and more. |

## 📦 Installation & Releases

SnapVox ships as **standalone executables** — download and run, no installer wizard required. Two builds are published with every release:

1. **[SnapVox.exe](https://github.com/alonreich/SnapVox/releases/latest/download/SnapVox.exe)** — the core, blazing-fast Native AOT compiled executable.
2. **[SnapVox_tesseract.exe](https://github.com/alonreich/SnapVox/releases/latest/download/SnapVox_tesseract.exe)** — the standard deployment executable bundled with OCR capabilities.

Both links are *latest-release* permalinks and always download the newest build. There is never more than one release in this repository: each publish replaces everything that came before it.

## 🛠️ Build from Source

Requirements:
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Windows 10/11
- GitHub CLI (`gh`), signed in — only needed for the publish step

Clone the repository and run the build script to generate the binaries in the `.\compiled\` directory:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/alonreich/SnapVox.git
cd SnapVox
.\Build.cmd
```

The script compiles both binaries, stamps them with a `vYYYY.MM.DD.HHmm` version, then **replaces the one-and-only GitHub release**: every pre-existing release and tag — local and remote — is deleted first (no exceptions), a fresh release is published with `SnapVox.exe`, `SnapVox_tesseract.exe` and `LICENSE.txt` as assets, and the upload is verified by SHA256 digest.

To build without touching GitHub at all:

```powershell
.\Build.cmd --no-publish
```

## ⚖️ License & Open Source Compliance

SnapVox is proudly open-source and is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)**.

### Why GPLv3?
To provide you with the most reliable capture engine possible, portions of SnapVox’s low-level native capture logic, bounds calculations and highlight filter were adapted from **[Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/)**, an incredible open-source screenshot tool. Because Greenshot is licensed under the GPL, SnapVox inherits this license to ensure full compliance and respect for their hard work.
